/********************

Settings Explained:

input_folder: Path to your DOOM: The Dark Ages game installation
Example: input_folder = "C:/Steam/steamapps/common/DOOMTheDarkAges"

output_folder: Where to output extracted files
Must be < 16 characters long to prevent export failures due to long file paths
Example: output_folder = "D:/DA"

run_extractor: Set to 0 if you only want to run the deserializer

run_deserializer: Set to 0 if you only want to run the extractor
(NOTE: The deserializer isn't added yet so this won't do anything for now)

------

Advanced Extractor Settings:

resource_types: The types of resources that will be extracted.
All officially supported resource types are included by default.

You can exclude any type by commenting it out like this:
// rs_streamfile


WARNING: Adding resource types not officially supported by this extractor
may lead to undesired behavior! Do this at your own risk.
